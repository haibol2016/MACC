# MACC

An R package to compute MNase accessibility scores ([Mieczkowski, Cook, Bowman et al. Nat Commun. 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11485)).

Chromatin accessibility plays a fundamental role in gene regulation. Nucleosome placement,
usually measured by quantifying protection of DNA from enzymatic digestion, can regulate
accessibility. We introduced a metric that uses micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion in a
novel manner to measure chromatin accessibility by combining information from several
digests of increasing depths. This metric, MACC (MNase accessibility), quantifies the
inherent heterogeneity of nucleosome accessibility in which some nucleosomes are seen
preferentially at high MNase and some at low MNase. MACC interrogates each genomic
locus, measuring both nucleosome location and accessibility in the same assay. MACC can be
performed either with or without a histone immunoprecipitation step, and thereby compares
histone and non-histone protection.
